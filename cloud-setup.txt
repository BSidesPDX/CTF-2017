Log on to the GCP console.
Create a new cluster (5 micro nodes, for example)
Follow the Details->Connect To Cluster instructions to run "kubectl proxy"
Now the kubectl commands should work and you can launch deployments and services on this cluster

Notes: To firewall the cloud services on GCP, edit the yaml for the service. After type: LoadBalancer, add:
   loadBalancerSourceRanges:
     - <cidr>
     - <cidr>
Where cidr can be <ip>/32 for a single host.
