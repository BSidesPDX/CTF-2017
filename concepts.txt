100 HTTPSH - Give the clue as https://website/, but have it just be an SSL wrapped shell session. Player must figure out that their GET / is getting executed (since browsers will just bail).

This challenge will trick the player into thinking they need to play 2048 and win when the challenge is really a format string bug to run shellcode written to the games input buffer.
