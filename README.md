## Local Deployment

To locally test, deploy or play challenges with Docker, run the following (Ubuntu)

1. `sudo apt install gcc-multilib gcc-mipsel-linux-gnu gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi g++-multilib linux-libc-dev:i386`
1. `make`
1. `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`
1. Containers are viewable at localhost:PORT (view with docker-compose ps)
1. `docker-compose kill` to stop the containers
1. `make clean` to clean the source folders

## GCP

You can also deploy via GCP and run the challenges in k8s. All of this is in `category/challenge/Makefile` to deploy.

## BSidesPDX

CTF was ran during [BSidesPDX 2017](https://bsidespdx.org/events/2017/contests-events.html) on October 20th and 21st.

We used [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) for the scoreboard hosted at [BSidesPDXCTF.party](https://bsidespdxctf.party/).

`category/challenge/aws/Makefile` was used to deploy to a k8s pod in AWS. We had intended to use the GCP deployment and moved to this by creating our own cluster with the help from the above infra supporters.
